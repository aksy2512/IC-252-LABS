Q2) ii) The expected incubation period by excluding Wuhan residents is same as the pmf of the incubation
        period without excluding it. This shows that much of the data of Wuhan residents is missing.
   iii) There is not much similarity between first and second,third plots but we can see that there 
        is slight similarity between the second and third graph in terms of spread of the graph.
        The difference b/w H-O pmf for surviving and dead patients is that the surviving patients 
        were taken early to the hospital as compared to the dead patients.
