Q1 i) The variance seems moderate . We can say that mainly the infected people are of age ranging
      between 28 and 50.
   ii) The expectation for recovered ages doesn't have much difference than the expectation of
      infected ages but the the expectation for death ages is considerably high as compared to both.
      We can say that people from all ages are recovering after observing its high variance value but
      mostly the older people are expiring which shows that elderly aged people are at an higher risk 
      than other ages.
   iii) No,The PMFs are not identical though they have the same value of Expectation because the 
        variance of an infected male patient is pretty much high as compared to that of a Female
        infected patient.
